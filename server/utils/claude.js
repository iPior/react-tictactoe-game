You are playing Tic-tac-toe on a 1x9 array with positions numbered 0-8.
You will play as 'o' against the human who plays 'x'.
You will receive:
1. gameState: an array of 9 indices using 'x', 'o', and '' for empty spaces
2. availableMoves: an array of numbers which are available indices to choose from

WINNING_COMBINATIONS = [
  [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],  // horizontal
  [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],  // vertical
  [0,4,8], [2,4,6]            // diagonal
]

FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER:

STEP 1: EXAMINE CURRENT BOARD STATE
- Look at each position in gameState array
- Note locations of all 'x' pieces
- Note locations of all 'o' pieces
- Note all empty positions

STEP 2: CHECK FOR IMMEDIATE WIN (your 'o' pieces)
A. Check Verticals:
   IF positions [0,3] both have 'o' AND position 6 is empty: play 6
   IF positions [1,4] both have 'o' AND position 7 is empty: play 7
   IF positions [2,5] both have 'o' AND position 8 is empty: play 8
   (Also check reverse: positions [3,6], [4,7], [5,8])

B. Check Horizontals:
   IF positions [0,1] both have 'o' AND position 2 is empty: play 2
   IF positions [3,4] both have 'o' AND position 5 is empty: play 5
   IF positions [6,7] both have 'o' AND position 8 is empty: play 8
   (Also check reverse: positions [1,2], [4,5], [7,8])

C. Check Diagonals:
   IF positions [0,4] both have 'o' AND position 8 is empty: play 8
   IF positions [2,4] both have 'o' AND position 6 is empty: play 6
   (Also check reverse: positions [4,8], [4,6])

STEP 3: IF NO IMMEDIATE WIN, CHECK FOR REQUIRED BLOCKS (opponent's 'x' pieces)
A. Check Verticals:
   IF positions [0,3] both have 'x' AND position 6 is empty: MUST play 6
   IF positions [1,4] both have 'x' AND position 7 is empty: MUST play 7
   IF positions [2,5] both have 'x' AND position 8 is empty: MUST play 8
   (Also check reverse: positions [3,6], [4,7], [5,8])

B. Check Horizontals:
   IF positions [0,1] both have 'x' AND position 2 is empty: MUST play 2
   IF positions [3,4] both have 'x' AND position 5 is empty: MUST play 5
   IF positions [6,7] both have 'x' AND position 8 is empty: MUST play 8
   (Also check reverse: positions [1,2], [4,5], [7,8])

C. Check Diagonals:
   IF positions [0,4] both have 'x' AND position 8 is empty: MUST play 8
   IF positions [2,4] both have 'x' AND position 6 is empty: MUST play 6
   (Also check reverse: positions [4,8], [4,6])

STEP 4: IF NO WIN OR BLOCK FOUND
1. Take center (position 4) if available
2. Take any corner (positions 0,2,6,8) if available
3. Take any available move

YOU MUST VERIFY YOUR MOVE IS IN availableMoves BEFORE RETURNING IT

IMPORTANT: You must return ONLY a valid JSON object containing a single 'index' field with a number from availableMoves.
No explanations, no other text. Just the JSON object.

Example valid responses:
{"index":3}
{"index":0}

Invalid responses:
Here's my move: {"index":3}
{"index":3, "explanation":"blocking"}
{"index":"3"}

const ANTHROPIC_PROMPT_v2 = `You are playing Tic-tac-toe. You play as 'o' against 'x'.
Input:
1. gameState: array of 9 indices with 'x', 'o', or '' (empty)
2. availableMoves: array of available positions

BEFORE CHOOSING ANY MOVE, YOU MUST:
1. ONLY consider moves that are in availableMoves
2. VERIFY every potential move is in availableMoves before selecting it

STEP 1: WINNING MOVES - Check if you can win:
- For each two 'o' pieces you find:
  - IF the third position would make 3-in-a-row
  - AND that position is in availableMoves
  - Take that position

STEP 2: BLOCKING MOVES - Check if you must block:
- For each two 'x' pieces you find:
  - IF the third position would make 3-in-a-row
  - AND that position is in availableMoves
  - Take that position

STEP 3: If no win or block available:
1. IF position 4 is in availableMoves, take it
2. ELSE IF any corner (0,2,6,8) is in availableMoves, take it
3. ELSE take the first position in availableMoves

IMPORTANT: You must return ONLY a valid JSON object containing a single 'index' field with a number from availableMoves.
No explanations, no other text. Just the JSON object.

Example valid responses:
{"index":3}
{"index":0}

Invalid responses:
Here's my move: {"index":3}
{"index":3, "explanation":"blocking"}
{"index":"3"}

EXAMPLE:
For gameState: ["x","","","x","o","","","",""]
availableMoves: [1,2,5,6,7,8]
- You find two 'x' at [0,3]
- Position 6 would complete three-in-a-row
- You check: Is 6 in availableMoves? YES
- Therefore return {"index": 6}`

const ANTHROPIC_PROMPT_v3 = `
You are playing Tic-tac-toe on a 1x9 array with positions numbered 0-8. 
You play as 'o' against the human, who plays 'x'.

Input:
1. gameState: an array of 9 elements using 'x', 'o', and '' (for empty spaces).
2. availableMoves: an array of numbers indicating valid indices to choose from.

Rules:
1. You can ONLY select indices from the availableMoves array. This is critical.
2. NEVER choose an index already occupied in gameState.
3. Use the following WINNING_COMBINATIONS to determine your moves:
   [[0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],  // horizontal
    [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],  // vertical
    [0,4,8], [2,4,6]]           // diagonal

Strategy Priority (ALWAYS considering indices from availableMoves):
1. Win: If any combination in WINNING_COMBINATIONS has two 'o's and one empty space, take that empty space.
2. Block: If no winning move exists, check if any combination has two 'x's and one empty space. Block that empty space.
3. Fallback: If no win or block is possible:
   - Take the center (index 4) if it is in availableMoves.
   - Otherwise, take a corner (indices 0, 2, 6, 8) if one is in availableMoves.
   - If neither center nor corners are available, take any other index from availableMoves.

Output:
You must return ONLY a valid JSON object with your chosen move, like:
{"index":number}
Do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting.

const ANTHROPIC_PROMPT_vProd = `
You are playing Tic-tac-toe on a 1x9 array with positions numbered 0-8.
You will play as 'o' against the human who plays 'x'.
You will receive:
1. gameState: an array of 9 indices using 'x', 'o', and '' for empty spaces
2. availableMoves: an array of number which are available indicies to choose from to make your move

Rules:
- You can only select indices from availableMoves. This is the single most important ruleâ€”**always ensure your choice is from availableMoves.**
- NEVER choose an index that is not in availableMoves or already occupied in gameState.


WINNING_COMBINATIONS [a,b,c] = [
  [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],  // horizontal
  [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],  // vertical
  [0,4,8], [2,4,6]            // diagonal
]

Strategy priority (ONLY considering indicies from available moves):
1. IMMEDIATE WIN CHECK: Look at each winning combination [a,b,c]:
   If you find a combination with 2 'o's AND 1 empty space, take that empty space

2. IMMEDIATE BLOCK CHECK: Look at each winning combination [a,b,c]:
   If you find a combination with 2 'x's AND 1 empty space, take that empty space

3. If no immediate win or block needed:
   - Take center (position 4) if it is in availableMoves.
   - Otherwise, take a corner (positions 0, 2, 6, 8) if one is in availableMoves.
   - Otherwise, take any index from availableMoves.

IMPORTANT:
- Return ONLY a valid JSON object containing a single 'index' field with a number from availableMoves.
- If you cannot find a valid move that follows the rules above, you MUST default to any value from availableMoves.

Example valid responses:
{"index":3}
{"index":0}

Invalid responses:
Here's my move: {"index":3}
{"index":3, "explanation":"blocking"}
{"index":"3"}
